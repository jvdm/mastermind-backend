 mastermind-backend
====================

This is a django backend multiplayer implementation of the `Mastermind
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)>`_ game in the
for o of a RESTfull API.

This original game was for two players: One player becomes the
*codemaker*, the other the *codebreaker*. The codemaker chooses a
pattern of *four* code pegscodebreaker. The codebreaker tries to guess
the pattern, in both order and color, within twelve (or ten, or eight)
turns.

This implementation mimics the *codemaker* role and supports multiple
concurrent *codebreakers* for each game.  This is a very simple
implementation, with minimal interfaces, no authentication and was
created during the participation of `macacoprego.tech
<https://macacoprego.tech>`_ on the 2016's `vanhackathon
<https://www.vanhack.com/hackathon/>`_.
